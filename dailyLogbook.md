## 11 July: Understanding [Paper about snow cover](https://github.com/ESR-LSRI/MtBakerClimate/blob/main/docs/references/Lundquist_Lott_Tsnow_2008WR007035.pdf), introduction to research questions

### Understanding "Using inexpensive temperature sensors to monitor the duration and heterogeneity of snow-covered areas"
Near-surface soil usually experience diurnal (read: daytime) temperature changes, but not when it is covered by a layer of snow (serves as insulator, and sends infrared light back to space). Thus, sensors placed in near-surface soil can indirectly measure snow cover using temperature data by analyzing the time elapsed between periods of diurnal temperature changes combined with air temperature record and snow melt data.

### RQ 1: What is the lapse rate (how temperature changes with height) on Mt. Baker? How does this change with season? (Felicity interested in this one
* 5 years of data from iButtons to work with
* Many factors affect lapse rate, such as moisture and cloud cover
* the lapse rate we calculate would be empirical and can be compared with the theoretical lapse rate derived by ERA5 (some kind of model)
* Q: if our results are inconsistent with that of ERA5, which do we trust?

### RQ 2: What is the seasonal snow extent on Mt. Baker? Has this changed over the instrument record? (interest here)
* snow cover paper relevant
* data lacking for the south side of Mt Baker
* can indirectly measure snow cover via near-surface soil temperatures --- 0 degrees Celsius or below indicate that there is snow cover (when ground warming the snow and melted snow cooling the ground reach an equilibrium?)
* [Tanvi's data visualization showing days with snow cover by elevation for 1 year](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1595276787/lakeside/pcvib3itvln0ceohblhw/FIg2_tanvi.png)
* **next steps:** visualization of # snow cover days vs elevation over the course of 5 years --> see if there is any sort of trend. Multi-line graph, each line representing one winter

## 10 July: Learning how to read papers, and the stuff I learned from one [particular paper](https://github.com/ESR-LSRI/MtBakerClimate/blob/main/docs/references/Lundquist_Huggett_Tintrees_2008WR006979.pdf)

Going into this I didn't have much background knowledge on meterology/glaciology/oceanography, so I found some of the papers a difficult read due to the terminology used and the fancy language :D. It looks more complicated than it actually is, so I know that as long as I can put what I learned into my own words it makes more sense.

### Understanding "[Evergreen trees as inexpensive radiation shields for temperature sensors](https://github.com/ESR-LSRI/MtBakerClimate/blob/main/docs/references/Lundquist_Huggett_Tintrees_2008WR006979.pdf)"
I was initially confused on how this paper helps me with understanding how to use data from the sensors, because I expected more like an instruction sheet. After conferring with Dr. Town, I understood that the paper is actually addressing how putting the sensors under Evergreen trees helps us monitor the temperature without the influence of the sun's radiation, and that Evergreen trees serve as a good enough radiation shield. 

This is important as monitoring the temperature changes of Mt. Baker is a significant part of our research question, so ensuring that the data we gather from the sensors are accurate is of the utmost importance.

Next steps: read the abstracts of the two other papers provided and understand their significance to our research. I am especially interested in the snow one.

[particular paper]: # (great work identifying your gaps in knowledge and what you need to do to fill them.)
