# Service Learning Notebook for Zara

### Who will your project serve?
As the Mt. Baker group, our research can impact, in some way or another, everyone who is a part of the Mt. Baker ecosystem. This includes people in agricultural communities who rely on the snowmelt for water as well as everyone else who relies on it for energy.

### How will these "constituents" be served?
I hope our research can help climate scientists make better models and predictions of climate change, policy makers create better policies that protect affected communities, and engineers design better solutions to these problems.
